      Itachi Uchiha also known as "The God of Genjutsu".Renowned for his intelligence and mastery of the Sharingan, he
      was both feared and respected. Despite being shrouded in mystery and often misunderstood, Itachi's actions were
      driven by a deep sense of duty and love for his younger brother, Sasuke. His story is marked by sacrifice,
      redemption, and the complexities of loyalty and morality.
