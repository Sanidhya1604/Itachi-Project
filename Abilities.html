      Itachi's Abilities

    <span class="bio">
      Even within the famed and battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi was a genius of such talent, never before seen in
      Konoha's history. Despite his young age, he became one of the strongest shinobi Konoha ever produced.
      Well-known for consistently showing prowess far beyond his years, he quickly rose through the ranks; graduated
      from the Academy in 4 months at age 6, earned the fastest time in completing the second test of the Chūnin Exams
      while competing solo at age 10, and became an Anbu captain at age 12. He was highly proficient in all three
      main ninja skill sets, effortlessly learning new techniques from simple observation, and gained praise from allies
      and foes alike; Orochimaru, one of the Sannin, openly admitted Itachi was stronger than him, and Shisui,
      well-regarded as the strongest Uchiha of their time, viewed Itachi as stronger. Danzō considered him the kind
      of shinobi one sees maybe once a century. Despite being weakened from illness, while Sasuke had trained under
      and absorbed Orochimaru's power, Itachi could have killed Sasuke during their final battle if he wanted to.
      Even when restraining himself, Itachi still pushed a 3-man team of elite jōnin to their limits.
